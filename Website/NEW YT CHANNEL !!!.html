<h2 style="text-align: center;">What does your Tagline mean?</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Our tagline 
  “ Rejection Leads To Redirection “ 
  We have chosen this as our tagline to show our viewers that nothing can stop them . Whether they get rejected , lose something or encounter a negative event , it should not define who they are . Just because you got rejected at a job you wanted does not mean it's over . We want to show that we should not take everything seriously and that life is not over . Everything happens for a reason and that reason is that there is always time for self growth and that something better will always come your way . Many people get rejected from the things in life but that didn't stop them as something much better came .  </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who are your target audience?</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">Our target audience will mostly be teenagers/adolescents but all ages are welcome, who are having a hard time in life finding their true selves and wanting to know who they really are and what they are capable of. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Who are your competitors</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">There would be no competitors, since we’re advocating for the same concept, how to find yourself and to discover your self identity, why fight with other advocaters when we can grow and help others?.
